  "description": "This is a new WIP project that is aimed at helping personal guitar, musical keyboard or computer keyboard music practice. It originates from a personal requirement for being able to put together a chart of notes to practice. This could be for a scale/mode or a chord across the instrument. Basically it helps you focus on the notes you wanna play and practice. For instance on a musical keyboard, you may want to just highlight the C Minor scale so that you can play over it. This little app will let you select the required root note and the scale to generate this:",
